# Quantum Computing vs. Quantum Engineering

[Quantum Computing]|(masters-in-quantum-computing.md) and quantum engineering are related but distinct concepts. [Quantum Computing]|(masters-in-quantum-computing.md) is the use of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations that are not possible or efficient with classical computers. Quantum engineering is the discipline that applies the principles of quantum physics to design, build, and operate quantum devices, systems, and networks, such as quantum computers, sensors, and communication systems. Quantum engineering bridges quantum science and conventional engineering. Both science and engineering will be required to make quantum computing a reality.
