# Quantum Computing vs. Quantum Technology

[Quantum Computing](masters-in-quantum-computing.md) and [Quantum Technology](masters-in-quantum-technology.md) are related but not identical fields of study. Quantum computing is a branch of quantum technology that focuses on using quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations that are faster or more efficient than classical computers. [Quantum Technology](masters-in-quantum-technology.md) is a broader term that encompasses [Quantum Computing](masters-in-quantum-computing.md), but also other applications of quantum physics, such as quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, quantum sensing, and quantum simulation. 

A master's degree in [Quantum Computing](masters-in-quantum-computing.md) typically covers the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, quantum hardware, and quantum software. 

A master's degree in [Quantum Technology](masters-in-quantum-technology.md) may include some or all of these topics, but also explore other aspects of quantum science and engineering, such as quantum optics, quantum materials, quantum devices, quantum networks, and quantum security. 

Depending on your interests and career goals, you may choose to pursue a master's degree in [Quantum Computing](masters-in-quantum-computing.md) or [Quantum Technology](masters-in-quantum-technology.md). Both fields are rapidly developing and offer exciting opportunities for research and innovation. However, they may also require different levels of mathematical and technical skills, as well as different types of courses and projects.
