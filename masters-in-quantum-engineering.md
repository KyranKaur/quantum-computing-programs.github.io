# Masters in Quantum Engineering

A Master's degree in Quantum Engineering is a graduate-level program that prepares students for careers in the field of quantum science and technology. Quantum engineering is a field that applies the principles of quantum mechanics to design and develop new technologies, such as quantum sensors, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Quantum engineering uses quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to create devices that can perform tasks that are impossible or very difficult for classical systems. Quantum engineering is an interdisciplinary area that involves physics, engineering, computer science, and mathematics.
